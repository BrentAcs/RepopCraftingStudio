Get the list of Ingredients/Agents for an Item.

Steps:

1. 	Select ItemId from tblItems (""Genetically Engineered Setlang")
2. 	Select recipe_result where resultId == itemId and groupId == "1"
2a.	loop for each result, can be more than one (example uses first)
3.	for each filter (1-4); Select componentIds from recipe_ingredients where recipeId matches and ingSlot == filter #
4.	for each filter (1-4); Select the unique item



SQL:
1. 	select * from items where displayname like 'Genetically Engineered Setlang'
2. 	select * from recipe_results where resultId = 442 and GroupId = 1
3.	select componentId from recipe_ingredients where recipeId=481 and ingSlot=1
	select componentId from recipe_ingredients where recipeId=481 and ingSlot=2
	select componentId from recipe_ingredients where recipeId=481 and ingSlot=3
	select componentId from recipe_ingredients where recipeId=481 and ingSlot=4
4.	select * from item_crafting_filters
	inner join item_crafting_components ON (item_crafting_components.itemId = item_crafting_filters.itemId)
	where item_crafting_components.componentId = 59 and item_crafting_filters.filterId = 15
	select * from item_crafting_filters
	inner join item_crafting_components ON (item_crafting_components.itemId = item_crafting_filters.itemId)
	where item_crafting_components.componentId = 490 and item_crafting_filters.filterId = 22

	
	
Results:
1. 	itemId = 442
2. 	recipeId = 481, filter1Id = 15, filter2Id = 22, filter3Id = 0, filter4Id = 0, 
	recipeId = 481, filter1Id = 15, filter2Id = 18, filter3Id = 0, filter4Id = 0, 
	recipeId = 481, filter1Id = 15, filter2Id = 17, filter3Id = 0, filter4Id = 0, 
	recipeId = 481, filter1Id = 15, filter2Id = 59, filter3Id = 0, filter4Id = 0, 
3. 	componentId = 59
	componentId = 490
